# FlutterJsonBeanFactory

Hi,Welcome to come to see me!
What I do is generate dart beans based on json, as well as generics parameters and json build instances


### Easy Use

<!-- Plugin description -->
### Usage
* Search 'FlutterJsonBeanFactory' in Intellij Idea Plugin Repositroy Or AndroidStudio Plugin Repository And Install it.</br>
    File --> Settings --> Plugins --> Browse Repositories -->Search FlutterJsonBean
* Restart your Develop tools 
* Press shortcut key `alt ` + `j` for mac  , right click on package -> `New`->`Dart bean clas file from JSON`　And Then you will know how to use
* If you change the fields in the class, just press the shortcut alt + j to regenerate the tojson and fromjson methods. The generated method regenerates all helper classes and JsonConvert classes (the same as the shortcut alt + j) each time an entity file is created in the generated/json directory.
* If you need generic conversions in your network requests, use the jsonconvert.fromjsonast method directly.
* If you don't want to use the FlutterJsonBeanFactory in your project, you can add flutter-json: enable: false to the pubspec.yaml file
* If no helper files are generated, you can delete the .idea directory and restart your idea
